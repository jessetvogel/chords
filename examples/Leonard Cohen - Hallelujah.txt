{Intro}
[C] [Am] [C] [Am]

{Verse 1}
I [C]heard there was a [Am]secret chord
That [C]David played and it [Am]pleased the lord
But [F]you don't really [G]care for music, [C]do you?[G]
Well it [C]goes like this the [F]fourth, the [G]fifth
The [Am]minor fall and the [F]major lift
The [G]baffled king com[E7]posing halle[Am]lujah

{Chorus}
Halle[F]lujah, halle[Am]lujah, halle[F]lujah, halle[C]lu-u-u-[G]u-[C]jah .... 

{Verse 2}
Well your [C]faith was strong but you [Am]needed proof
You [C]saw her bathing [Am]on the roof
Her [F]beauty and the [G]moonlight over[C]threw you[G]
She [C]tied you to her [F]kitchen [G]chair
She [Am]broke your throne and she [F]cut your hair
And [G]from your lips she [E7]drew the halle[Am]lujah

{Chorus}
Halle[F]lujah, halle[Am]lujah, halle[F]lujah, halle[C]lu-u-u-[G]u-[C]jah ....

{Verse 3}
[C]Baby I've been [Am]here before
I've [C]seen this room and I've [Am]walked this floor
I [F]used to live [G]alone before I [C]knew you[G]
I've [C]seen your flag on the [F]marble [G]arch
But [Am]love is not a [F]victory march
It's a [G]cold and it's a [E7]broken halle[Am]lujah

{Chorus}
Halle[F]lujah, halle[Am]lujah, halle[F]lujah, halle[C]lu-u-u-[G]u-[C]jah ....

{Verse 4}
Well [C]there was a time when you [Am]let me know
What's [C]really going [Am]on below
But [F]now you never [G]show that to me [C]do you[G]
But re[C]member when I [F]moved in [G]you
And the [Am]holy dove was [F]moving too
And [G]every breath we [E7]drew was halle[Am]lujah

{Verse 5}
Well, [C]maybe there's a [Am]god above
But [C]all I've ever [Am]learned from love
Was [F]how to shoot some[G]body who out[C]drew you[G]
It's [C]not a cry that you [F]hear at [G]night
It's [Am]not somebody who's [F]seen the light
It's a [G]cold and it's a [E7]broken halle[Am]lujah
   
{Outro}
Halle[F]lujah, halle[Am]lujah, halle[F]lujah, halle[C]lu-u-u-[G]u-[C]jah ....
